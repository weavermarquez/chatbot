*** With 5 few-shot in-prompt examples
I am very much unsatisfied with the creative writing quality of this system. There are a number of approaches I think will help.
- GEPA optimizer to add story and structure understanding
- Preparation of more data samples
- Incorporation of roleplay prompts

*** Remaining Work

So what we have right now is 34 examples which can serve as exemplar or evals or a few-shot pool, and then we also have right now an idea of a workflow.
Workflows B and C may need to sit aside for another week since I must finish my UI for tomorrow which I haven't really gotten started on. I know I will most likely need to display the story beats on a Table.
**** Overall Workflow
The product idea that I have at the moment is to take the user's
- character information, which could also be about a product, for example. This serves also as starting point, potentially.
- the central imbalance
- the user's selection of story structure, possibly. I think it's best for users to choose for educational purposes.

And eventually make a video script. I could market it as story generation for startup launch videos.

**** Workflow A
The product idea that I have at the moment is to take the user's
- character information, which could also be about a product, for example. This serves also as starting point, potentially.
- the central imbalance
- the user's selection of story structure, possibly. I think it's best for users to choose for educational purposes.
Output:
- provide a "bare bones" list of story beats that conform to the user details and story framework.


**** Workflow B
Once we have that down I want for users to be able to *play with* the expansion and contraction of stories for Workflow B. But that is a separate step, which will require an entirely different signature, optimization run, and also additional data augmentation of our exemplars.

**** Then Workflow C, I want to take that snapshot of story state/structure and turn it into a video script.
