I'm interested in applying GEPA to create an optimized prompt for generating stories in accordance to the theory of a story structure framework. I have collected 32 examples of full story texts, their categorizations, and the result of the analysis of the story structure turned into a list of story-beats. The general goal is in accordance to this signature: ``` const storyGenerator = ax(` characterName:string "The main character", characterDescription:string "A description of the character at the start of the story.", centralImbalance:string "The problem around which the story revolves." -> storyStructure:class "Quest, Transformation, Trickster, Trickster Variation, Death and Rebirth" // up to 18 story structures... storyBeats:json[] "Story beats: the outlines are the events; annotated with appropriate symbol and structure." `); ``` I have with me a digital copy of the book that provides the theory behind these story structures. I would like to get help in setting up prompt opimization, the selection of the most appropriate opitmizer approach (I'm happy with defaulting to GEPA, though I'm not quite sure exactly what I'm optimizing for other than a) creating a good compelling story and b) adhering to the book's theory of story structures).
