* The Washerman and His Ass (Trickster Structure)

** Full Story Text / Narrative Outline (Input)

A childless washerman and his wife, believing a **mullah** (a religious teacher) can literally transform donkeys into human beings, pay him to transform their donkey into a son they can pass their savings to, who will perform the last rites for them when they die. The mullah agrees after negotiating a handsome fee, telling them to return in a year and a day. Knowing they will return, he prepares a ruse to get revenge on a rival—a **qazi** (a judge) in a nearby town. When the couple arrives, the mullah tells them they just missed seeing their son take up the position of qazi, and that they should take his feed bag and halter and show them to him. He assures them the qazi will recognise these items and be reunited with them as their son. The qazi, taken aback by their public behaviour, receives them in private and understands they have been duped. Rather than burst their bubble, he plays along with the ruse, only asking them to keep his story secret. In exchange, he promises to fulfil his duties towards them as a son and perform the last rites for them. As a result, they leave him all their wealth. The qazi benefits, and the mullah loses out.

* Hsün Chü-po Visits His Friend (Trickster Variation Structure)

**  Full Story Text (Input)

**Hsün Chü-po** travelled a great distance to see his friend, who was stricken ill. It happened that at this time the prefecture came under attack by the **Tartars**. The sick friend said to Chü-po, "Now I am about to die. You should leave immediately." "My friend lies ill," Chü-po answered, "and I cannot endure the thought of leaving him. Spare his life and take mine in its stead!" At this, the Tartars marvelled. "Indeed, we are iniquitous men who have come to the land of the righteous." So they gathered their troops and departed, and the prefecture was saved from destruction.

* The Story of Cornix (Transformation Structure)

**  Full Story Text / Narrative Outline (Input)

Once when I \[Cornix] was walking slowly as I used to do along the crest of the sands by the shore the sea-god \[Neptune] saw me and grew hot. When his flattering words and entreaties proved a waste of time, he tried force, and chased after me. I ran, leaving the solid shore behind, tiring myself out uselessly in the soft sand. Then I called out to gods and men. No mortal heard my voice, but the virgin goddess \[Minerva] feels pity for a virgin and she helped me. I was stretching out my arms to the sky: those arms began to darken with soft plumage. I tried to lift my cloak from my shoulders but it had turned to feathers with roots deep in my skin. I tried to beat my naked breast with my hands but found I had neither hands nor naked breast. I ran, and now the sand did not clog my feet as before but I lifted from the ground, and soon sailed high into the air. So I became an innocent servant of Minerva.

* Lazy Jack (Trickster Structure)

** Full Story Text / Narrative Outline (Input)

Lazy Jack’s story line starts with his mother sending him out to get a new job. He returns having earned a penny, which he promptly loses in a slot in the floor on the way home, leading to his mother telling him he should have put it in his pocket. This begins a cycle that repeats multiple times:

1.  **Penny:** Jack loses it; Mother advises putting it in his pocket.
2.  **Milk:** He puts the milk in his pocket and loses it. Mother advises carrying it on his head.
3.  **Cheese:** He carries the cheese on his head, losing and crushing it. Mother advises carrying it carefully in his hands.
4.  **Cat:** He carries the cat in his hands, but it scratches and escapes. Mother advises tying it to a string.
5.  **Meat:** He ties the meat to a string, dragging it home where it is destroyed. Mother advises carrying it over his shoulder.

Finally, Jack is sent off to get a new job. He earns a **donkey**, which, following his mother’s last piece of advice, he carries back over his shoulder. Passing through town, he is seen by a supposedly deaf and dumb girl who **bursts out laughing** at the sight and starts to speak. They end up married and live happily together with Jack’s mother.

* Nasr-el-Din Hodja and the Walnut Tree (Quest Structure)

This example features a detailed narrative reflecting Hodja's philosophical journey and the full 10-step Quest structure analysis, which contains two complete unfortunate/fortunately pairs of steps ($\leftleftarrows \rightharpoons$).

**  Full Story Text / Narrative Outline (Input)

Once upon a time, **Nasr-el-Din Hodja** lay under a walnut tree to rest. While his body was at rest, his mind was troubled. **He couldn’t understand why Allah, in His infinite wisdom had paired a big, strong tree and small, light walnuts**. Hodja had an idea – **he thought that it would be far better for large pumpkins to grow on sturdy trees, and small walnuts on the slender stems of creeping plants**. Sleep came to him before he could follow this train of thought further. A walnut fell on him from the tree and woke him up. He realised that if the world had been constructed according to his scheme, he would have been killed. He then realised that there was a good reason why things were the way they were rather than the way he thought they should be. And he never questioned the wisdom of Allah ever again.

**  Structured Analysis: Hodja’s Story Line (Output)

The problem Hodja faces is a **lack of clarity and understanding**, which is resolved when things are finally clarified. This story follows the **Quest structure**, symbolized by **$r\ \text{m}\ \leftleftarrows\ \rightharpoons\ \leftleftarrows\ \rightharpoons\ \leftleftarrows\ \rightharpoons\ \text{m}\ r$** [49–51, 70, 72, 464].

* KILL 2. The Woman who Humoured her Lover at Her Husband’s Expense (Trickster Structure)

This is a complex narrative featuring nested Trickster and Quest structures. This story (Aarne-Thompson-Uther type 1741) revolves around a wife who successfully tricks her husband multiple times for the benefit of her lover, while using Trickster steps to neutralize threats (such as the guest and her husband's friend).

**  Full Story Text / Narrative Outline (Input)

The following narrative is based on the version found in *The Arabian Nights* [115, 135n12]:

A woman conspires with her lover while her merchant husband is away on business. The lover arrives, and they meet and agree to a plan. The husband returns with a friend/guest (as requested by the wife). The wife tells the merchant that one friend is not enough. This leaves the guest alone with the wife, who frightens him by telling him her husband wants to castrate him, making him run off. Just as the husband returns with more guests, he is told the first guest stole the geese. The husband runs off after the first guest, believing he wants to recover at least one goose. Meanwhile, the first guest believes the merchant wanted to castrate him (take "one of his balls"). The first guest leaves town, and the couple and their remaining guests end up having a simple meal together. As for the lover and the geese, that is "another story for another time".

**  Structured Analysis: Multi-Character Trickster Sequence (Output)

The core Trickster actions are found in the sequence where the wife deceives both the first guest and her husband. This analysis shows how the multiple character story lines intersect using the **Trickster symbol ($\leftleftharpoons$)** to denote cognitive dissonance and defeated expectation.

| **6**   | $\leftleftharpoons$ | … one is tricked or duped | … who told him that her husband wanted to castrate him …. (Wife tricks guest)                                                   |

| **8**   | $\leftleftharpoons$ | … one is tricked or duped | … to be told the first guest had stolen the geese …. (Wife tricks husband again)                                                |
| **9**   | $\leftleftarrows$   | Meeting between …         | … making the husband run off after the first guest ….                                                                           |
| **10**  | $\leftleftharpoons$ | … one is tricked or duped | … to get at least one goose back, while that guest thought the merchant wanted one of his balls. (Final Transformational Twist) |

The Trickster step ($\leftleftharpoons$) involves a defeated expectation based on an Aristotelian categorical cognitive dissonance. In this case, the husband is duped because he misunderstands the social situation and the motivations of the guest and his wife.

* KILL Summary of Poetic Structures

The methodology is also applied to regular poetic forms, where the structure is based on **patterns of anticipation and expectation** rather than character events. These can be useful for mapping aesthetic output.

* The Wolf in The Three Wee Pigs (Trickster Structure)

**  Full Story Text / Narrative Outline (Input)

The wolf's motivation is hunger, which drives his quest for food. He encounters three houses in turn, behind which he senses an increasing number of pigs. He attempts to dissemble (pretend to be a well-meaning visitor) at the first two houses but is refused entry. He blows down the first two houses and fails to catch Biddy and Dennis. He then attempts to gain entry to the third, stronger house via the chimney. This attempt results in him encountering burning straw, leading to his defeat.

* Cinderella (Rags to Riches Structure)

**  Full Story Text / Narrative Outline (Input)

Cinderella begins life in a relatively positive condition. The problem (Reversal) arrives when she experiences a **reversal of fortune** (her mother dies, and she is ill-treated by her stepmother and stepsisters), placing her in a state of subversion. She is unable to solve her problem alone. A metaphysical friend/helper (often a supernatural external force) intervenes, allowing her to attend the ball (Journey/Meeting). She then experiences a **reversion** to her previous state, but in an altered state of consciousness (she now has hope/a slipper). The Saviour character (the Prince) follows a **nested Quest** to find her (Final Quest).

* The Story of Medusa (Transformation Structure)

**  Full Story Text / Narrative Outline (Input)

In one version of her history, **Medusa** was originally a beautiful mortal maiden. **Neptune** (Poseidon), overcome by lust, took advantage of Medusa in **Minerva’s** (Athena’s) temple [127, 132n5, 132n6]. Minerva, viewing this as a **transgression against the natural order** (her temple being defiled), punished Medusa, transforming her hair into snakes and giving her a hideous appearance. By transforming Medusa's extreme beauty into extreme ugliness, Minerva punished either Neptune or Medusa for their transgression.

* Snow White (Death and Rebirth Structure)

**  Full Story Text / Narrative Outline (Input)

The *Snow White* story line begins with a lack: the Queen wants a child with skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as ebony (Problem/Lack). Her wish is granted (Lack Fulfilled). However, a reversal occurs when the Evil Queen (who acts as a “negative” metaphysical helper) curses Snow White. Snow White attempts to avoid the price but fails, pricking herself and falling into a death-like sleep (Submersion). Time passes until a Prince (the Saviour character) arrives, and his action breaks the curse. They marry, restoring order (Final Situation).

* Neptune's Quest in The Story of Cornix (Quest Structure)

**  Full Story Text / Narrative Outline (Input)

**Neptune** (the sea-god) saw the maiden Cornix walking by the shore and was overcome by desire. Neptune first used "flattering words and entreaties" (Journey) but when these failed, he resorted to force. His quest to possess Cornix was **thwarted by Minerva**, who intervened and transformed Cornix into a crow, thereby restoring the natural order. Neptune's desire remained unfulfilled.

**  Structured Analysis: Neptune's Story Line (Output)

Neptune's story line follows the full 10-step Quest structure, where Minerva acts as the **Enemy/Hindrance** who defeats his objective.

* The Academic Essay (Quest Structure)
**  Full Story Text / Narrative Outline (Input)

A five-part academic essay begins with an **Introduction** (Initial situation/Opening). The author identifies a specific **Problem** to address. The **Thesis** functions as the Journey, stating the main solution. The body paragraphs provide **Evidence** (Meeting with...), which requires **Analysis** (Friend/Helper) to support the thesis. Finally, the essay reaches a **Conclusion** (Final situation/Outcome). (Note: The structural requirements of the Quest model ensure that arguments against the thesis—the 'wolf'—are addressed and defeated through sound reasoning.)

* The Moon and His Two Wives (Perpetual Motion Structure)

**  Full Story Text / Narrative Outline (Input)

The **moon** is a man who has angered the **sun**. Every month, the moon reaches a state of round **prosperity** (fullness). However, the sun’s knife then cuts away pieces until finally only a tiny piece is left, which the moon pleads should be left for his children. It is from this tiny piece that the moon gradually grows again to become full, continually recurring in a **cycle of fullness and depletion**.

* The Story of Arachne (Transformation Structure)

**  Full Story Text / Narrative Outline (Input)

**Arachne**, a mortal skilled in weaving, consistently **refused to acknowledge the source of her gift** (Minerva/Pallas) and chose to compete against the goddess's skill. Arachne further transgressed by weaving depictions of divine acts of transgression (gods raping young women) onto her tapestry. Though **Minerva** found no technical fault, she struck Arachne on the forehead for her transgressions. Minerva then transformed Arachne into a spider and condemned her to **spin webs** in perpetuity.

* IDEA The Limerick (Revelation Structure)

A Limerick is typically a five-line poem (AABBA) where the first line sets up the character and setting. The second and third lines introduce a complication or unexpected event (often involving transgression), and the final line resolves the dissonance. The form itself sets up an expectation ($\leftleftarrows$) which is fulfilled ($\rightharpoons$).

* The Ghazal Poetic Form (Perpetual Motion Structure)

**  Full Story Text / Narrative Outline (Input)

A ghazal typically consists of 5 to 25 couplets. The first couplet sets up a rhyme scheme (AA), and subsequent couplets use this rhyme in the second line (BA, CA, DA...). The repetition sets up an expectation ($\leftleftarrows$) that is fulfilled by the next rhyming line ($\rightharpoons$), which immediately sets up a new expectation, creating an unending flow until the poet's name appears, signalling the end.

Grendel, sensing an excessive state of good (the revelry at Heorot), approaches the hall. The sequence follows $\text{veni}$ (He heard the rumour of merriment), $\text{vidi}$ (He visited the mead hall at night, saw it with his own eyes, confirming his suspicion), and $\text{vici}$ (He made his attack and emerged with his spoils/conquered).

**  Structured Analysis (Output)

The Revelation structure uses the unmarked state ($\text{u}$) to show the decisive outcome ($\text{vici}$ step), which resolves the initial doubt.

Two hunters in the forest suddenly become thirsty (Initial Situation/Problem). One hunter declared, “I’ll dig a well. You find a bucket” (Journey). In the same instant, he broke open the ground with a mighty kick, and pure fresh water gushed forth. Immediately, the second hunter produced a bucket. They quenched their thirst (Crossroads/Paradox).

The Story Spinner then presents the **dilemma** to the audience: **“Which man was the most worthy?”**. The story ends here for the original characters, transferring the Quest for resolution to the Story Seekers.

* KILL Limerick Poetic Form (Salman Rushdie's Kim Kardashian)

**  Full Story Text / Narrative Outline (Input)

The analysis focuses on the metrical form (AABBA rhyme scheme, implied rhythmic patterns):

"The marriage of poor Kim Kardashian (A) / Was krushed like a kar in a krashian. (A) / Her Kris kried, 'Not fair! (B) / Why kan't I keep my share?' (B) / But Kardashian fell klean outa fashian. (A)".

The first line sets up anticipation ($\leftleftarrows$). The second line fulfills the expectation ($\rightharpoons$). Lines 3 and 4 present a **defeated expectation** in rhythm/rhyme. The final line resolves the form, completing the $\text{Revelation structure}$.

**  Structured Analysis (Output)

The Limerick form follows the **Revelation structure**, a Threshold structure.

* KILL The Haiku Poetic Form (Buson’s Crows) (Open-ended Ki-Sho-Ten-Ketsu Structure)

**  Full Story Text (Input)

This Haiku by Buson is used to analyze the pattern of expectation and reconciliation required by the form:

"They end their flight one by one— / crows at dusk. / Buson".

The form uses two related images—the flight of crows and the dusk—to create a sense of opposition, which the reader must reconcile, often leading to a confirmation of something intuitively known (an 'Ahhh!' effect).

**  Structured Analysis (Output)

The structure is a highly compressed, dynamic form: $\text{r m } \rightharpoons \rightleftharpoons \text{ m r}$.
